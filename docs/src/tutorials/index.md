# Tutorials

## Installation

Installation of the Element requires an integrated development environment and database.
Instructions to setup each of the components can be found on the
[User Instructions](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide/) page. These
instructions use the example
[workflow for Element Zstack](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-zstack),
which can be modified for a user's specific experimental requirements. This example
workflow uses four Elements (Lab, Animal, Session, Calcium Imaging, and Zstack) to construct a
complete pipeline, and is able to ingest experimental metadata and process
volumetric microscopic calcium imaging scans.

# Roadmap

Through our interviews and direct collaboration on key projects, we identified the common motifs to create Element ZStack.  Features of this Element include:

- [x] Ingest the metadata of a volumetric image.
- [x] Perform cell segmentation of a volumetric image using [cellpose](https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose){:target="_blank"}. 
- [x] Upload the volumetric image and cell segmentations to [BossDB](https://bossdb.org/){:target="_blank"} and store the BossDB URL.
- [x] Generate a link to visualize the image and segmentations with [Neuroglancer](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer){:target="_blank"} and store the URL.

Further development of this Element is community driven.  Upon user requests and based 
on guidance from the Scientific Steering Group we will add further features to this 
Element.

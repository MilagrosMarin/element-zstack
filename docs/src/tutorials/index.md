# Tutorials

+ DataJoint Elements are modular pipelines that can be connected into a complete workflow.  [Workflow Zstack](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-zstack) is an example that combines five DataJoint Elements - Lab, Animal, Session, Calcium Imaging, and ZStack.

+ Workflow ZStack includes an [interactive tutorial on GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-zstack#interactive-tutorial), which is configured for users to run the pipeline.

+ In the interactive tutorial, the [example notebook](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-zstack/tree/main/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) describes the pipeline and provides instructions for running the pipeline.

## Installation Instructions for Active Projects

+ The Workflow ZStack described above can be modified for a user's specific experimental requirements and thereby used in active projects.

+ The GitHub Codespace and Dev Container is configured for tutorials and prototyping.  
We recommend users to configure a database specifically for production
pipelines.  Instructions for a local installation of the integrated development
environment with a database can be found on the [User
Guide](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide/) page.

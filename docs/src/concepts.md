## Key Partnerships

Over the several years, many labs have developed DataJoint-based pipelines for volumetric
data. The DataJoint team interviewed and collaborated these teams to
understand their experiment workflow, associated tools, and interfaces. These teams
include:

- Andreas Tolias Lab, Baylor College of Medicine
- Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University

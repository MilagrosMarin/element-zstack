# Element BossDB for storing volumetric data

DataJoint BossDB for volumetric data processing via BossDB. DataJoint Elements
collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience
experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with
corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a
fully functional pipeline. This Element ....

- features a DataJoint pipeline design for volumetric neuroimaging data, including
  segmentation and connectomics.

- is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of
  tables and dependencies.

- can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.
